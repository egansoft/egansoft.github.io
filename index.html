                            Ever since I picked up coding at age 10, the power to create has been an irresistible pull.
                            I taught myself by poring over books, and was blown away by the possibilities when I
                            discovered how software development could unleash my ideas and make them real. I started
                            <a href="http://egansoft.com" target="_blank">Egansoft</a> in 7th grade initially as a
                            repository for my ever growing list of programming projects, and eventually into a business
                            for publishing software and creating web sites for clients. I take every opportunity
                            available to learn more and do more, by founding and running a hack club at my high school,
                            interning at research labs and software corporations, assembling teams to take to hackathons,
                            and creating web apps to help members of my community. I am currently a student at MIT
							studying Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6-3).

                                  Auditionr is a site that allows directors of plays or movies to find actors for their
                                  productions. It was inspired by talks with friends in the acting industry who are
                                  frustrated by the fact that one's ability to be cast in a production is often limited
                                  by their location, connections, and luck. One of the largest advantages of in-person
                                  auditions is that the actors can see each other and play off each other's acting, so
                                  we replicated that experience by putting you in a live stream with people auditioning
                                  for other parts of the same play so that you can act through the script together. We made Auditionr
                                  in 36 hours at <a href="http://lahacks.com/" target="_blank">LA Hacks 2015</a> and won
                                  the Best Use of Respoke API prize. A full online release will be coming soon.

                                    at my high school in which sophmores learn about European history, music, and art
                                    from the Greeks until now. Many believe the most challenging part of Civ tests to be
                                    the music listening section, in which different parts of pieces we studied are played
                                    for us to identify and write about. The Civ Music Tool simulates this section
                                    of the test by randomly generating snippets of songs we need to know and playing them
                                    back so the user can practice identifying them. This tool became immensely popular, with up to 70% of
                                    the class using it to study before tests, leading to my school's Academic Dean and
