                            I taught myself by poring over books, and was blown away by the possibilities when I
                            discovered how software development could unleash my ideas and make them real. I started
                            <a href="http://egansoft.com" target="_blank">Egansoft</a> in 7th grade initially as a
                            repository for my ever growing list of programming projects, and eventually into a business
                            for publishing software and creating web sites for clients. I take every opportunity
                            available to learn more and do more, by founding and running a hack club at my high school,
                            interning at research labs and software corporations, assembling teams to take to hackathons,
                            and creating tools to help members of my community.
                            I am currently a Masters of Engineering candidate at MIT with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence.-->

                                  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the state of the art neural network
                                  models for image generation, but the use of GANs for video generation is still largely
                                  unexplored.
                                  My MEng thesis improves upon previous GAN based video generation models by
                                  introducing the technique of model inflation and proposing the segmentation-to-video task. The
                                  model inflation technique converts image GANs into video GANs,
                                  and experiments show that model inflation improves training speed, training
                                  stability, and output video quality. The segmentation-to-video task is that of turning
                                  an input image segmentation mask into an output video matching that segmentation.
                                  I created a GAN model to perform this task and demonstrated its usefulness as a creative tool
                                  for turning hand-drawn sketches into realistic looking videos.

                                  The Generator of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained to transform latent vectors
                                  drawn from a prior distribution into realistic looking photos. These latent vectors have been
                                  shown to encode information about the content of their corresponding images. Projecting input
                                  images onto the latent space of a GAN is non trivial, but previous work has successfully performed
                                  this task for latent spaces with a uniform prior. We extend these techniques to latent spaces with
                                  a Gaussian prior, and demonstrate our technique's effectiveness. This was our final project
                                  for 6.867, MIT's graduate level class on machine learning, and our paper is available

                                  N Chainz is a high performance, decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.
                                  The most unique aspect of our design is the use of multiple blockchains to reach a unified consensus state:
                                  we maintain a separate token chain for each token added to the exchange as well
                                  as a match chain, which coordinates a loose consensus between tokens.
                                  The reference implementation includes p2p nodes, miners, a matching engine, chain coordinators,
                                  addresses and wallets, a client CLI, and an orderbook web interface.

                                  Auditionr is a site that allows directors of plays or movies to find actors for their
                                  productions. It was inspired by talks with friends in the acting industry who are
                                  frustrated by the fact that one's ability to be cast in a production is often limited
                                  by their location, connections, and luck. One of the largest advantages of in-person
                                  auditions is that the actors can see each other and play off each other's acting, so
                                  we replicated that experience by putting you in a live stream with people auditioning
                                  for other parts of the same play so that you can act through the script together. We made Auditionr

                                    from the Greeks until now. Many believe the most challenging part of Civ tests to be
                                    the music listening section, in which different parts of pieces we studied are played
                                    for us to identify and write about. The Civ Music Tool simulates this section
                                    of the test by randomly generating snippets of songs we need to know and playing them
                                    back so the user can practice identifying them. This tool became immensely popular, with up to 70% of
